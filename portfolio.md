### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
Quantified self went very well.  Styling has always been a weak point for me, there were some odd UI stories, and tables are notoriously hard to style, but we still managed to make something with decent styling, accessibility, and responsiveness.  We also kept very good communication and workflow, did some error handling with proper status codes, and even wrote some JS unit tests with stubs.  And I think it was pretty well-factored for a pair with zero experience making a jQuery app.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
No single thing, just the sheer number of competing concerns. That includes my projects, job hunt prep, PIP, living/financial situation, strained long-distance relationship, continuing to pair/mentor, and more.  From that, I learned better organization and stress management and such.

Asking for help is one struggle at which I'm still [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JosiMcClellan/loomio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JosiMcClellan/loomio).  I've made some progress, but not enough, but these days every failure is a lesson learned and therefore a step forward.  One exacerbating factor is that people here think I'm "so good at code" (I'm good at _certain_ things) that I don't need help, so I actually have explicitly asked for help and been either ghosted or explicitly told no. And that doesn't make it easier to ask the next time.  Thankfully, that factor shouldn't persist after Turing though.

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
Helping others is a huge one.  Even facing a time crunch, I helped numerous 1801/1803 students, TA'd a Try Coding, and even helped people in my own mod with JavaScript and React all the time.

I also starting writing some nicely-factored React code toward the end.  I think that I'm finally getting able to "think in React", and that if I did even one more React app having that knowledge from the start instead of the near the end, it could be really nice code.  Combined with the e2e testing I started learning in mod 3, this sets me apart as more full-stack proficient than most.

Note the timestamp here, I stayed back from graduation drinks because I wanted to finish this markdown.  I must have misread the slack or something, because I hadn't seen these questions until today, so I've been sneaking a sentence here and there throughout the day.

Finally, I believe I was _only_ one to put an emoji in my app's title, which was pretty darn cute.

### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
I'm now confident that I could quickly become effective with any (non-design) frontend work my job entails.  But the ranking hasn't really changed, it still goes: `pure coding > BEE > FEE > design`.

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
Communication, even though it's obviously something I still struggle with and regularly fail at.  But I came here so very, very bad at it, and with a neutral slope, and I've come a long way and will continue to practice and improve, so getting even to where I'm at now is impressive.
